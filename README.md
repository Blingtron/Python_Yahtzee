Python_Yahtzee
==============

A text-based Yahtzee written in Python 2.7, coming together as I learn how to program.

To use, run yahtzee_txt.py in python 2.7, choose one or two player, and follow the prompts. To keep dice, enter in index format "x x x x x"

To choose a scoring category, please choose from the following:

+ ones
+ twos
+ threes
+ fours
+ fives
+ sixes
+ 3k
+ 4k
+ fullhouse
+ smlstrt
+ lrgstrt
+ yahtzee
+ chance

I was going to make category choosing more flexible, but I would rather see it implemented in a GUI, which I may never get around to.
